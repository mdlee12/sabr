#sabr

The sabr package connects the Lahman SQL Database with functions used in calculating offensive performance in the MLB, namely wOBA. Created by Tom Tango and popularized in [The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball](http://www.insidethebook.com/woba.shtml), wOBA uses yearly MLB performance to weigh offensive measures relative to league value. This package offers the following capabilities:

- Retrieves the most up-to-date wOBA measures from 1871-2015
- Queries yearly and career offensive performance from the Lahman SQL database
- Calculates a player's seasonal wOBA performance

## Installation:

* the latest development version from github with

    ```R
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("mdlee12/sabr")
    ```

## Motivation:

wOBA is one of the best catch-all offensive performance statistics, but it's formula is a bit convoluted since it requires 1) ten distinct rate stats and 2) weighted values based on a season's run environment. 

For example, the wOBA formula for the 2013 season was:

wOBA = (0.690×uBB + 0.722×HBP + 0.888×1B + 1.271×2B + 1.616×3B +
2.101×HR) / (AB + BB – IBB + SF + HBP)
